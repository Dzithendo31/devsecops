All 2024 GLC300s are powered by a smooth-running turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. A 48-volt hybrid system helps augment the powertrain, which is good for 255 horsepower. A nine-speed automatic transmission is standard, as is rear-wheel drive, and Mercedes's 4Matic all-wheel-drive system is optional.
